# Documentation Generators

`documentationjs` is a documentation generator for API documentation.
It uses a code scanner and supports structured documentation, so it follows
in the tradition of tools like JavaDoc, Natural Docs, and JSDoc. There are
other camps of documentation generation, like literate documentation, which
is less structured and more focused on understanding internal code structure.
